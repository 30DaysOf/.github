# üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª You Can Learn Anything In #30Days

Yes, that was the simple motivation and inspiration for the projects that jumpstarted this organization. 
 * My initial goal was to create content based on a learning roadmap that would take you from learning the fundamentals to understanding best practices in 30 days - for different technologies.
 * My current goal is to take my learnings from the initial projects, and distill them into reusable assets (a template repository and a playbook) that will allow anyone to create and share your own project.
